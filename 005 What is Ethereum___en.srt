1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,780
We now have a better understanding of one of the original design goals of etherial, with that in mind,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,320
we're now going to continue and start talking about exactly what Ethereum is and how we work with it.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,130
This is going to be our first description of many of the Ethereum system.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,440
And I say the first of many, because this is going to be kind of a primitive basic description of a

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,910
theorem.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,140
And as we go throughout the course, we're going to come back and address more and more complicated

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,110
topics in the Ethereum ecosystem.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,940
So, again, this is our first taste and we're going to come back again and again and freshen up or

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,430
kind of sharpen our understanding of different pieces of this puzzle.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,060
So let's take a look at this diagram right here.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,980
It's kind of a complicated diagram, but I want to focus on some of these notes.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,510
I have off to the right hand side.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,550
We're going to talk about each of these notes starting at the top and working our way down to the bottom.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,190
And I'm going to do my best not to just read the text on here.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,440
They're kind of prompts and I'm going to discuss further about each of them.

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,530
So the first thing we need to understand is that when we work with the theorem, we are working with

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,240
a network of computers.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,090
These networks are used to transfer money between different parties like you and me, and they're also

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,140
used to store data.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,410
The transfer of money and the storage of data are what allows us to create interesting applications,

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,580
which, remember, is the entire goal of etherial.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,970
The second thing to understand is that there are many different Ethereum networks.

23
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:33,120
When you read about Ethereum in the news, you usually hear about, oh, the price of either coins is

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,130
so-and-so dollars or you might hear about deploying apps to the theory and block chain or the entire

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,590
network.

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,170
In reality, there's one main Ethereum network that everyone uses for deployment of production applications,

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,010
and it's where ether coins are actually worth US dollars or real money, I should say.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,800
However, there are many other Ethereum networks out there.

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,780
There are test networks, so networks that are used solely for testing code and testing transactions.

30
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,930
You can even create your own private Ethereum network on your own computer that is restricted to just

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,200
you.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,410
Or you can make your own network and open it to other people as well.

33
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,120
The point is that there's not just one Ethereum network out there.

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,900
There's many.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,830
And even in this course, we will be creating our own little network.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,260
Next networks are formed by one or more notes.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,870
And this goes coupled with the next note on here.

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,450
A node is a machine that is running an Ethereum client AC machine.

39
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,980
I'm talking about a desktop or a laptop or any type of computer, really.

40
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,520
So we take a node, we install some software on it, we run that software and then it connects to an

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,490
Ethereum network and starts becoming a part of the network overall.

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,240
All these networks connect, all these nodes connect together to form the actual network.

43
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,340
Next, anyone can run a note, so there's not just some specific set of people out there or important

44
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,640
companies who run nodes on the real Ethereum network, no, anyone can create one.

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,700
You can create a node.

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,660
I can create node.

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,640
All we have to do is turn on our laptop, download this client software and run it.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,100
And boom, we have a locally hosted node.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:25,000
Each node that we create or I should say each node on the network has a full and separate copy of the

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,610
block chain.

51
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,300
We haven't talked about the block chain too much just yet, but that will be a huge topic of discussion

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,120
throughout the course.

53
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,300
So for right now, let me give you a very basic description of the block chain we're going to stay for

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,330
right now that we can think of the block chain as being like a database that stores a record of every

55
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,850
movement of money between different parties.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,530
And it's also where we store data.

57
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,130
Again, the key thing to keep in mind here is that the block chain can be considered to be a simple

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,730
database and nothing else.

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,390
All right.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,320
So that's our first taste of what Nithari network is.

61
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,810
Again, I just want to throw some of these very basic descriptions and definitions out there, and it's

62
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,930
going to help ground us throughout the next task that we're going to go through.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,500
So let's pause right here.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,660
We're going to continue the next video and we're going to start getting our hands dirty in that next

65
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,110
section.

66
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,510
So I'll see you in just a minute.
